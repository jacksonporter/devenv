This repository is a base to get started with a extensible local development environment.

## Getting started

To get started, you'll need to install operating system dependencies and some tools. To make this easy, we've wrapped this logic in scripts!

### macOS/Linux

Navigate into this directory in the terminal and execute:

```shell
./scripts/bootstrap/bootstrap.sh
```

### Windows

Navigate into this directory in the terminal and execute:

```powershell
& .\scripts\bootstrap\bootstrap.ps1
```
